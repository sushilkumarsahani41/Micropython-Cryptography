## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

```python
from crypt import crypt

#to Generate Key
import uos 
key = uos.urandom(16) # it will generate an 128 bits AES Key

# or You Can Manually Add it
key = b'1234567890123456'

#  init crypt lib
c = crypt(key)

# To Encrypt Plain Text
plain_text = "Hello World"
encrypted_text = c.encrypt(plain_text)

# To Decrypt Encrypted text 
decrypted_text = c.decrypt(encrypted_text) # For Decryption text must be in a form of bytes 

```
# Thank You 

# Happy Coding
